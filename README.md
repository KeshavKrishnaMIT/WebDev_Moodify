# 🌈Mood-Based Activity Explorer

This is my first complete web project that I designed, built, and deployed live using Google Firebase.
The core idea of this project is to recommend activities based on a user’s mood, making the interface simple, interactive, and mobile-friendly.

This project marks my first hands-on experience with real-world frontend development and cloud deployment.

## 💡 Core Idea

People often don’t know what to do when they feel a certain way — happy, sad, calm, or energetic.
This project solves that by:

Letting users select their current mood

Showing relevant activity suggestions for that mood

Keeping the experience simple, aesthetic, and distraction-free

The focus was on clean UI, smooth interaction, and logic clarity, not complexity.

## 🚀 What I Built

✔ A responsive mood selector UI
✔ Dynamic activity suggestions using JavaScript logic
✔ Smooth navigation sections like Home / About / Explore
✔ Mobile-first design so it works properly on phones
✔ Simple code structure for easy understanding and future scaling

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 – structure of the project

CSS3 – layout, gradients, responsiveness, and animations

JavaScript (Vanilla) – mood logic and dynamic content

Google Firebase Hosting – live deployment

Git & GitHub – version control and project hosting

No frameworks were used — everything is built using core web fundamentals.

## 🌐 Deployment (Big Milestone 🎯)

This is my first project deployed on the internet using Firebase Hosting.

Through this, I learned:

How real projects go from local → live

Using Firebase CLI for deployment

Linking GitHub workflow with production-ready code

Fixing responsiveness and interaction bugs after deployment

## 📘 What I Learned from This Project

Structuring a frontend project properly

Writing readable and logical JavaScript

Making layouts responsive for mobile devices

Debugging real UI interaction issues

Hosting and maintaining a live website

Confidence to build and deploy future projects

This project gave me the confidence that I can actually build and deploy real products, not just write code in theory.

## 🧑‍💻 Why This Matters to Me

As a beginner, this project represents:

My transition from learning concepts → building real things

My first successful cloud deployment

A solid foundation for bigger and more advanced projects ahead

This is not just a project — it’s a starting point.
